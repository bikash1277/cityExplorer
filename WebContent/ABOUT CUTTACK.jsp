			<h1>History of Cuttack</h1>
			<p>
				<span>Founded in the year 989 A.D. by the Keshari Dynasty,
					Cuttack is one of the oldest cities of India. Anglicized from a
					Sanskrit word, 'KATAK' which means the military camp or seat or
					fort of a kingdom, upon which the city has being named as Cuttack.
					Inscriptions of Anangabhimadeva lll refer the orginal city as
					Abhinab-Baranasi-Katak. Like the city of Baranasi, situated in
					between Baruna and Asi, Cuttack is situated between the rivers
					Mahanadi and Kathajodi and was therefore named as Abhinab Baranasi
					(a new type of Baranasi). Cuttack developed into a city out of five
					villages' viz. Choudwar Katak, Saranasi Katak, Sarangagarh Katak,
					Viraja Katak and Amaravati Katak. In the remote past, Cuttack was
					connected both by land routes and waterways with the renowned
					medieval ports like Chelitalo, Palur and Tarmalipti.</span> <br> <img

					rulings of Ganga dynasty under the rulings of Emperor Anangabhima
					Deva. Later on Gajaptati kings ruled the City of Cuttack which then
					came under the rulings of Mughals and Muslim Emperors after death
					of the last Hindu king who ruled, Raja Mukunda Deva. Kalinga was
					the name of Odisha in past and Katak was its capital which was then
					shifted to Bhubaneswar after India got the freedom in 1947.
					Bhubaneswar being a planned city but was the most favored option
					for the capital of the state but the administrative capital of the
					state is still Cuttack as the High Court is situated here.</span>
